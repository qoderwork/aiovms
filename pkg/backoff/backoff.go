// Package backoff provides shared retry-backoff helpers used across the VMS
// (ONVIF discovery/probe, MediaMTX API calls, camera health checks).
//
// The strategy tiers delays so that transient failures recover fast while
// long-term-unreachable targets back off to a minute, with jitter to avoid
// thundering herd when many goroutines reconnect at once.

// spamming logs and burning CPU with sub-second retries. We still retry
// periodically so recording resumes quickly once storage recovers.
